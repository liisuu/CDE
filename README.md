# CDE
Matlab Codes of the algorithm proposed in our paper https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8006761 for caculating the minimum rate of Cooperative Data Exchange problems over fully connected networks.

Script CCDE_Example.m shows how to use our algorithm MNRT.m to caculate the mimimum rate for cooperative data exchange problem over fully connected networks.

Script CCDE_weighted_Example.m shows how to use our algorithm MNRT_weight.m to caculate the optimal rate vector and minimum weighted cost for cooperative data exchange with weighted cost problem over fully connected networks.

Script SLO_example.m shows how to use our alogrithm MNRT_SLO.m to caculate the optimal rate for successive local omniscience.
